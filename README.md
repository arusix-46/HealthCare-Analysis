#Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

##Project Overview

The Healthcare Analytics Dashboard is a data visualization tool designed to centralize and analyze healthcare data across India. It provides actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare administrators, and public health officials, enabling data-driven decisions in healthcare planning, resource allocation, and public health monitoring.

##Features

	1.	Infrastructure Analysis
	•	Maps the distribution of wellness centers and healthcare facilities across India.
	•	Identifies regions with infrastructure gaps, such as doctor-to-population ratios.
	2.	Health Trends Monitoring
	•	Tracks key health indicators, including stillbirth rates, C-section trends, HPV cases, and mental health statistics.
	•	Offers year-over-year comparisons to observe trends and measure healthcare outcomes.
	3.	Resource Allocation Insights
	•	Visualizes funding distribution across states and healthcare facilities.
	•	Analyzes public health spending as a percentage of GDP and identifies patterns in resource allocation.
	4.	Interactive Dashboards
	•	Provides an easy-to-use interface with real-time filters and drill-down capabilities.
	•	Allows users to explore data by region, time period, and specific healthcare metrics.

##Technologies Used

	•	Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
	•	Data Visualization: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Statistical Analysis: Minitab (for regression and hypothesis testing)
	•	Dashboard Integration: Tableau (for interactive dashboards)

##Dataset Description

	•	Source: Publicly available healthcare datasets, such as wellness centers, public health facilities, and vaccination data.
	•	Time Periods: Data spans various timeframes, including 2000-2021 for stillbirths, 2008-2012 for polio vaccination, and 2015-2019 for mental health statistics.
	•	Features: Includes data on facility locations, resource allocation, health outcomes, and key health trends.
	•	Format: The data is typically stored in CSV format for easy integration.

##Key Project Outcomes

	1.	Enhanced Policy Making Support
	•	The dashboard enables policymakers to make targeted, data-driven decisions for better healthcare planning and resource distribution.
	2.	Optimized Healthcare Management
	•	Provides administrators with insights into facility management and resource utilization, helping them respond to healthcare needs more effectively.
	3.	Improved Public Health Monitoring
	•	Tracks vaccination rates and disease trends, identifying accessibility gaps and supporting proactive public health interventions.
